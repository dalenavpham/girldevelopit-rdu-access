GDI Core Web Accessibility
======================
This is the official Girl Develop It Web Accessibility curriculum. It was originally developed by Sylvia Richardson. An update by Marcy Sutton converts it to a two-week class. There are four components: the course slides (classslides.html), a class activity handout (Kitten Alt text.docx), an HTML/CSS demo with two parts (demo.html and demo.css), and an instructor guide (Instructor Guide.docx).

## Suggested course description below

Who can use your websites? Are they accessible to as many people as possible?

Web accessibility has traditionally described the process of enhancing websites for people with disabilities. Come to this class to learn more about developing with accessibility in mindâ€”and building a better web experience for everyone.

This two-week class will focus on general design principles, with some hands-on exercises. It is helpful to have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. You should also plan to bring a laptop and some headphones to work along with the class.

## Theme customization

You can change theme colors by changing the theme css to any of the following options:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdidefault.css" id="theme">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdilight.css" id="theme">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdisunny.css" id="theme">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdicool.css" id="theme">
```
You can change the text editor theme by changing the highlight.js css to the following options:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/css/dark.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/css/light.css">
```
You can change transition by changing the reveal transition property in Reveal.initialize
```javascript
  Reveal.initialize({
  				transition:  'default', // default/cube/page/concave/zoom/linear/none
  			});
